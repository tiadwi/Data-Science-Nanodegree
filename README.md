# Data-Science-Nanodegree

This is a repository of my projects in Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Project 1: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post
In this project, I was conducting exploratory data analysis using a Diamond dataset from [ggplot2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/data-raw/diamonds.csv). This is a real-world dataset containing approximately 54K diamond prices with its features. After doing several data pre-processing techniques, I also developed machine learning models using K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest Regressor, and AdaBoost Algorithm from the sci-kit-learn library. I tried to communicate my findings in a Medium post which gives the readers insights into the questions of interest about the data.
