# Diamond Price Prediction and Data Analysis

## Library Import on Google Colaboratory
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn Library
- Seaborn

## Project Motivation
I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a Diamond Dataset from  [ggplot2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/main/data-raw/diamonds.csv). This is a real-world dataset containing approximately 54K diamond prices with its features. After doing several data pre-processing techniques, I also developed machine learning models using K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest Regressor, and AdaBoost Algorithm from the sci-kit-learn library to predict the diamond price. 

I tried to communicate my findings in a Medium post which gives the readers insights into the following questions of interest:

- How much money do you need to buy a diamond?
- What are the most highly correlated features with diamond prices?
- How to predict the diamond price based on its features?


## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions of interest. Please find the notebook [here](https://github.com/tiadwi/Data-Science-Nanodegree/blob/main/Project1/Udacity_Submission_1_Diamonds_Data.ipynb)

## Medium Blog Post
Data analysis and insights can be found in the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@tiadwi.s/how-to-measure-the-diamonds-worth-ae7b92bf7ec5)
